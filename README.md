# AirBnB clone v1 - The console
[AirBnB clone v1](https://github.com/Laban254/AirBnB_clone)

The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project at Holberton School that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

- A command interpreter to manage our Airbnb clone objects:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

- Retrieve an object from a file, a database 

- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

- Update attributes of an object

- Destroy an object

  ### Description
This is one phase of the Airbnb Clone: the HTML and CSS part. The Images folder holds icons for the site (e.g. logo, bathroom icons, bedroom icons, guest icons). The Styles folder holds CSS styling files. The largest numbered style file of each category (e.g. common, footer, header, places) is most relevant to the finished product. The highlest numbered index.html file is likewise the most relevant to the finished product.

[MODELS LINK](https://github.com/Laban254/AirBnB_clone_v2/tree/master/models)
AirBnB is a complete RESTful web application, integrating file and database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB. The front-end is designed using HTML5/CSS3 and is served using Python Flask. The application is configured on a distributed system - two web servers and one load balancer - with Nginx and HAProxy. AirBnB is still in active development, with complete functionality set to deploy in the coming month:

Complete integration of a RESTful API

Full configuration of website with domain name

Serving of dynamic content using JavaScript

### Background Context
Ever since you completed project 0x0F. Load balancer of the SysAdmin track, you’ve had 2 web servers + 1 load balancer but nothing to distribute with them.

It’s time to make your work public!

In this first deployment project, you will be deploying your web_static work. You will use Fabric (for Python3). Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks. It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well as auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or aborting execution. This concept is important: execute commands locally or remotely. Locally means in your laptop (physical laptop or inside your Vagrant), and Remotely means on your server(s). Fabric is taking care of all network connections (SSH, SCP etc.), it’s an easy tool for transferring, executing, etc. commands from locale to a remote server.

Before starting, please fork the repository AirBnB_clone_v2 from your partner if you don’t have it

[AirBnB clone v1](https://github.com/Laban254/AirBnB_clone)

The console is the first segment of the AirBnB project at Holberton School that will collectively cover fundamental concepts of higher level programming. The goal of AirBnB project is to eventually deploy our server a simple copy of the AirBnB Website(HBnB). A command interpreter is created in this segment to manage objects for the AirBnB(HBnB) website.

This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

- A command interpreter to manage our Airbnb clone objects:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

- Retrieve an object from a file, a database 

- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etcâ€¦)

- Update attributes of an object

- Destroy an object

AirBnB is a complete RESTful web application, integrating file and database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB. The front-end is designed using HTML5/CSS3 and is served using Python Flask. The application is configured on a distributed system - two web servers and one load balancer - with Nginx and HAProxy. AirBnB is still in active development, with complete functionality set to deploy in the coming month:

Complete integration of a RESTful API

Full configuration of website with domain name

Serving of dynamic content using JavaScript

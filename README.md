# Airbnb Clone Versions ðŸ“¯

This repository contains different versions of the Airbnb Clone project, showcasing progressive development and various features.

## Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone project is a web application that replicates the functionality of Airbnb. It is developed as a learning project at ALX Africa to explore different web development concepts and technologies.

# Version 1: The Console

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Laban254/AirBnB_clone)

### Description
Version 1 marks the inception of the Airbnb Clone project, where the focus is on creating a command-line interface (CLI) to manage objects for the Airbnb (HBnB) website. This CLI serves as the foundation for building the entire project.

In Version 1, key features include:
- **Object Management:** The CLI enables the creation of new objects (e.g., users, places), retrieval of objects from files or a database, and performing various operations on objects (e.g., counting, computing statistics).
- **Attribute Updates:** Users can update attributes of objects, enhancing the flexibility of managing data.
- **Object Deletion:** The CLI allows for the removal of objects, supporting data cleanup and maintenance.

### Web static
#### Description
This phase of the project focuses on the development of static web pages using HTML and CSS. The `web_static` folder contains HTML files and CSS styles for the project's static pages. These static pages lay the visual groundwork for the project.

The `web_static` folder structure includes:
- **Images:** This folder holds icons used on the website, such as logos and room icons.
- **Styles:** CSS stylesheets are organized into categories (e.g., common, footer, header) for effective styling of different page components. The highest-numbered style files are most relevant to the finished product.

### Project Context
Version 2 represents a significant step forward in the Airbnb Clone project, improving the project's UI and making it more appealing to users. The enhanced UI sets the stage for further development, creating a solid foundation for the project's future.

### Deployment of Static Content
### Background
The deployment of static content is a critical aspect of project development. This phase ensures that static web pages, styles, and assets are delivered efficiently to end-users. In this context, project deployment involves making the project accessible to the public, utilizing two web servers and one load balancer.

### Deployment Methodology
The deployment process leverages Fabric, a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining SSH-based application deployment and system administration tasks. Fabric simplifies the execution of local or remote shell commands, including file transfers and other essential operations.

#### Key Steps in Deployment
1. **Cloning Repository:** Clone the project's GitHub repository to your local machine or server.

2. **Environment Configuration:** Set environment variables such as `BNB_ENV`, `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`, `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`, `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`, `HBNB_MYSQL_DB`, and `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE` to configure the project environment.

3. **Deployment Strategy:** Determine the deployment strategy that aligns with your project goals, ensuring that static content is efficiently distributed to end-users.
